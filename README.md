# Week4-NewtonRaphsonFractals
Basic code for Fractal plotting.

You will notice that this code is very slow, partly because of the 
large number of points being plotted, but mostly because it is 
not written very efficiently. 
See the repo Week4-FasterFractals for a walk-through of how to 
speed it up. (https://github.com/PM520-Spring-2020/Week3-FasterFractals)

What this version has (that the faster one doesn't), is that it shows 
how to use a different color palette (called "viridis", but there are 
many others available), instead of the default R palette.
This allows much more beautiful pictures to be created.

Assignment 2a asks you to do the following:

Take the code for Newton-Raphson on the complex plain from Github: 
Basic [slow] code: https://github.com/PM520-Spring2022/Week4--NewtonRaphsonFractals.  [has pretty graphics but is very slow].
Better [faster] code: https://github.com/PM520-Spring2022/Week4--FasterFractals [I will walk you through this is a minute] 

Use it to draw some fractals for some functions other than those we saw in today’s class. [e.g., Google “Julia Sets”]
Write a report in Rmarkdown including your R code, and describing the functions you tried, but also including some pretty pictures for display at the start of class in four week’s time. They must be drawn by your R code. (R’s gg-plot package is your friend here.)

Each person should also commit one picture. You are encouraged to give it an pretentious/artsy name. We will vote on who has the best (and I will provide some sort of prize for the best picture).
Upload both your code as an Rmd and the picture (as a pdf) you wish to enter into the art show.

Please submit your answers for this assignment to this repository.
